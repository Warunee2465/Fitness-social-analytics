### Tools used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Power BI | Dashboard + business insights reporting |
| Python / Jupyter (Matplotlib) | Exploratory plots + validation |
| Excel / CSV | Data preparation |

## Key Insights

- Twitter + Facebook drive most engagement → marketing resources should focus there.
- Best engagement time to post: **Tuesdays, around 12:00–17:00** → ideal timing for promos & events.
- Topics with highest discussion: **Equipment & Facilities**, **Workout / Training**, **Customer Service & Feedback**.
- Neutral sentiment is common → opportunity to make posts more positive by sharing real success stories, progress, & customer recognition.

## How this creates business value (for a fitness owner)

- Post ads & campaigns when people are most active → higher conversion for same budget.  
- Focus content on Training + Equipment themes — they attract the most discussion.  
- Engage fans on Twitter / Facebook — these channels generate far more attention than Instagram.  
- Share before–after stories / progress results — to shift neutral mentions into more positive buzz.
